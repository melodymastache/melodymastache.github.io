### Hi, I'm Melody Mastache 

I'm a 2020 computer programming graduate from Seneca College looking for opportunities in front-end development and UI/UX Design. I'm currently working on building and expanding my portfolio to showcase my skills in JavaScript and CSS. I'd love to be able to collaborate on a design project with someone who could show me the ropes in the UI/UX industry and what I would need to succeed as as designer.
